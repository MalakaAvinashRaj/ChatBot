# ChatBot

This was a Python ErrorSolver ChatBot. 
I have developed it using python and its modules.
One can use this tool and all they need to do is to type their errors in it and it will display a optimal solution for it.
Most of the regular errors are pre-defined and the remaining were directed to the stackoverflow.

This was an open source project and you were provided copyrights about it so that you can use it for your personal purpose or can change its code to make a better version of it.
If anyone have made or have a upgrading plan to this code kindly contact me and i'm happy to help you.
